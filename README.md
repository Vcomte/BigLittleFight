        Welcome to this BigLittleFight demo
BigLittleFight is a game made by a group of students from
Les Gobelins / ENJMIN (Specialized Master Interactive 
Digital Experiences)during a two weeks project where the 
students had to create a game of their choice with the
following theme: the wolrd of Antman && || Wonder Woman

This version is the version presented at the "Journ√©e portes
ouvertes" at Gobelins on January 26th 2017.

Concept: 	BigLittleFight is a 2 players 2D fighting game
			where each player controls a character from	
			the Antman universe. In this demo only Antman
			and Yellowjacket are availiable and both have
			the same powers.
			The point for each player is to go as right as
			possible (for Antman) or as left as possible 
			for Yellowjacket by beating their opponent.
			The system is Nidhogg inspired, each player gets
			one shot when hit by his opponent. When a player
			dies it automatically appears back after a few seconds.
			The winning player should use this time to go as
			quickly as possible to its side of the current room.
			
Instructions:
			The game has been developped for 2 players using 
			Xbox 360 controllers. It can be played directly
			from the MainMenu scene, or from the GameScene.
			After finnishing a game, the players must restart
			the whole game in order to play again (going back
			to menu has not yet been implemented).

Controls:
			- The players can move left/right with the left stick
			- They can jump with A
			- They can use their power (shrinking) with Y
			- They can hit with the right trigger while aiming
			up and down with the left stick (aiming up will
			throw a punch and aiming down will throw a kick)
			- They can parry attacks by holding the left trigger
			while aiming up and down with the left stick
			- While under their small form (obtained after using
			the power Y) the players can no longer parry attacks
			but are far faster and can know perform "Dashes"
			instead of regular punches and kicks.
			
Warning:
			This demo has been known to interact in a weird
			way with controllers from time to time. Do not
			hesitate to restart the computer and unplug / 
			plug the controllers again to fix this.
			The problem will basically prevent the controller's
			triggers from working at all, though preventing
			the players to fight (that's not what we want do we?)
